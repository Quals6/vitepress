# Creating Documentation
Elysia has first-class support and follows OpenAPI schema by default.

Allowing any Elysia server to generate a Swagger page and serve as documentation automatically by using just 1 line of the Elysia Swagger plugin.

To generate the Swagger page, install the plugin:
```bash
bun add @elysiajs/swagger
```

And register the plugin to the server:
```typescript twoslash
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'
import { swagger } from '@elysiajs/swagger'

const app = new Elysia()
    .use(swagger())
```

For more information about Swagger plugin, see the [Swagger plugin page](/plugins/swagger).

## Route definitions
`schema` is used to customize the route definition, not only that it will generate an OpenAPI schema and Swagger definitions, but also type validation, type-inference and auto-completion.

However, sometime defining a type only isn't clear what the route might work. You can use `schema.detail` fields to explictly define what the route is all about.

```typescript twoslash
import { Elysia, t } from 'elysia'
import { swagger } from '@elysiajs/swagger'

new Elysia()
    .use(swagger())
    .post('/sign-in', ({ body }) => body, {
        body: t.Object(
            {
                username: t.String(),
                password: t.String()
            },
            {
                description: 'Expected an username and password'
            }
        ),
        detail: {
            summary: 'Sign in the user',
            tags: ['authentication']
        }
    })
```

The detail fields follows an OpenAPI V3 definition with auto-completion and type-safety by default.

Detail is then passed to Swagger to put the description to Swagger route.
